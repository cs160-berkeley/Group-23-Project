Our application is called Run To My Beat. It is connected to a fitbit device that reads user's heartrate and the application uses that information to play songs with certain bpm to either raise/lower heart rate. 

The first task that I'm going to demo is changing the target heart rate. When the application first loads, up, it displays a screen where a user can adjust the heart rate. Here you can see the plus and minuses signs are working. For this demo, I'm going to set the heart rate to 85. 

The second task that i'm going to show is user running faster/slower to change music. The fitbit's heartrate data is emulated here by this pin in the kinoma create. We've currently set the heart rate as 130 * the value that is displayed on the pin. For example, the slider at .5 would equal 65. 

	When the user's heart rate is lower than the target heart rate by more than 15, the song bpm category increases after playing/skipping 3 songs. 
	Vice versa, user's heart rate is higher than the target heart rate by more than 15, the song bpm category decreases.

	Right now the user's heart rate is lower than the target by 20. so after 3 songs, the song category bpm changes to 100. 

	I will increase the heart rate of the user to 130. Now, the song category bpm will change back to 90 and than 80.
